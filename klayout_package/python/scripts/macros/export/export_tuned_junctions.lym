"""Exports junctions of a chip to a separate file. Parameters of individual junctions may be tuned.

Assumes that a single chip exists in the top cell.
Will export a new .oas file in TMP path containing junctions of original cell,
with possibly tuned junction parameters, and a metal gap layer for reference.
This new layout will also be opened in current KLayout session in new layout.
Macro can be used on cells with or without PCell data.
In the latter case the `tuned_junction_parameters` must include a value for every
junction parameter of every junction in the cell.
You can use "export_junction_parameters" macro on a PCell to get full listing of parameters,
to later reuse on cells without PCell data.

See kqcircuits.util.replace_junctions API docs for more technical details.
