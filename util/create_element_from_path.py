# Script to create a KQCircuits element in KLayout by specifying the path to the module file containing the element.
# This script can be used to integrate with external editors.
#
# Command line usage:
#   klayout -e -rx -rm util/create_element_from_path.py -rd element_path=kqcircuits\chips\demo.py
#
# Here, the flags specify the following:
#  -e: Run KLayout in edit mode
#  -rx: Skip running automatic startup scripts (avoids creating a second empty layout)
#  -rm: Run this script on startup
#  -rd: Inject a variable element_path into the script scope containing the path of the element module to create.
#       element_path should be relative to the kqcircuits repository, and it should be a module containing exactly
#       one KQCircuits Element or Chip.
#
# To use this as an external tool in Pycharm:
# - Under Settings -> Tools -> External Tools create a new entry as follows:
#   - Program: point to klayout_app.exe (Windows) or the klayout executable (Linux)
#   - Arguments: -e -rm "$ContentRoot$\util\create_element_from_path.py" -rd
#                element_path="$FilePathRelativeToProjectRoot$"
# - To execute, right click the python file (in the Project browser on the editor tab) containing the element to create
#   and choose the tool under External Tools.
#
# To use this as a task in Visual Studio Code, add the following snippet to your `.vscode/tasks.json`.
# Linux users may need to edit the "command" field to point to KLayout.

# To use this as a macro command in Vim/NeoVim
#   1. Open your Vim or NeoVim configuration file.
#
#      Linux/macOS:
#        * Vim: The configuration file is located at ~/.vimrc.
#        * NeoVim: The configuration file is located at ~/.config/nvim/init.vim.
#      Windows:
#        * Vim: The configuration file is located at $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc or $VIM/_vimrc.
#        * NeoVim: The configuration file is located at $HOME/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim.
#
#        These are default paths, Usually installed in this path unless changed upon installation.
#
#        The configuration file may not be present, in which case you need to create one at a specified location.
#        Use the following command to verify that vim loaded the expected configuration file:
#            :e $MYVIMRC
#
#   2. Add the following lines to your configuration file:
#       " Define a kqc command
#       command! -nargs=0 Kqc
#         \ execute "!klayout -e -rm {FULL PATH TO create_element_from_path.py} -rd element_path=" . expand("%:p") |
#         \ redraw!
#       " Create a mapping to run the kqc command
#       nnoremap <leader>kqc :Kqc<CR>
#
#       After copy-pasting, substitute {FULL PATH TO create_element_from_path.py} with the absolute path to the
#       util/create_element_from_path.py python script.
#       On Windows, klayout command does not work automatically, in which case it is best to substitute klayout keyword
#       with the expanded absolute path to %APPDATA%/KLayout/klayout_app.exe
#
#   3. Save the configuration file and restart Vim or NeoVim for the changes to take effect.
#       Now, you can use the mapping <leader>kqc (where <leader> is a customizable key, often \ by default) while
#       editing a Python file containing the element to create.
#       Pressing the mapping will execute the :kqc command, which runs the external tool command to open the file in
#       KLayout.
#
# Register KQC plugins into KLayout (must happen before the layout view is created)
