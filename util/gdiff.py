"""
This is a geometry diff tool to compare .oas or .gds files using LayoutDiff.

Expects two arguments: two files or two directories. It only compares OASIS or GDS2 files. If an
additional `-s` argument is given it will use `SmartCellMapping` to match PCells that may have been
renamed. Optional `-k` argument fires up KLayout and loads the differing files for further
investigation.

By default it runs using a single CPU, for extra speed, but also extra memory usage(!), you may
specify the number of CPUs to use in parallel, like: `-c 4`.

When two directories are compared it descends recursively and considers all .oas and .gds files.
Files only present in one directory will be reported to the user. Files present in both directories
are compared and reported if different.
